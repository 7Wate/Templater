# Internal Command Templates

Thanks for considering contributing to [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) !

Developing a new internal command template is almost the same process as developing a [INTERNAL_TEMPLATES](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater/blob/master/INTERNAL_TEMPLATES.md).

The only differences are the following:

- No prefix keyword is required, try to name your template patterns correctly, according to what it does.

And that's it ! The other rules are the same.

Just submit a [pull request](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater/pulls) when you're finished, I'll try to be as reactive as possible.
